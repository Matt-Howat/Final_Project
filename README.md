# Dominican Republic
Accumulation of my work on the Dominican Republic

## Administrative Subdivisions of the Dominican Republic

Within the Dominican Republic there are only two administrative levels, the provinces and the cities, many of the cities encapsulate the entirety of a province. The two cities that I chose to emphasise throughout the semester were Mao and Laguna Salada. They are located in Valverda, which is in the north west region of the Dominican Republic.

## Population of the Dominican Republic

## Population of the Domincan Republic's Districts

The Population of the Dominican Republic is nowhere near evenly spread. The masses of population are located in the capital, Santo Domingo, with over 28% of the population residing there. The choice of Mao and Laguna Salada from the province of Valverda was a middle ground choice. The distribution of population that Valverda receives is in the middle ground for the rest of the Dominican Republic. With the province's population it gives a good representation of what an average providence encapsulates. 

## Road Network and Healthcare Facilities within Mao and Laguna Salada

The infrastructure within Mao and Laguna Salada were severely lacking. There were no major health care facilities or clinics, and the only health care facilities were small doctors offices. With the mountainous terrain, especially in Mao, the limited amount of major roadways is understandable, however the residential roads are plentiful and are built throughout the rocky areas. The urban areas or human settlements are located surrounding the large clusters of residential roads. These clusters appear to resemble communities and that would be understandable if the urban areas are located around them. 

## Estimation of Urban Area Location

The previous two plots show the heat map of the population in both Mao and Laguna Salada. Using the density of the population we estimate the uraban areas within these two cities. The estimated urban areas are circled by the yellow line. These findings are supported by the covariates such as health care facilities, roads, slopes of the terrain, and terrain type.
